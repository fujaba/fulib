Pull requests are welcome.
Please target the `bugfix` branch for fixes and `develop` for features.
The `master` branch usually points to the latest release and should not be targeted.
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Pull requests should include a detailed description and a draft for the changelog.
If the pull request refers to an issue, please include the issue number as well as a closing keyword.
You can use the following template as a reference for the body:

Commit messages should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).
