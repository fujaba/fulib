# fulib Documentation

Welcome to the official fulib documentation.
You can learn how to define models, create class and object diagrams and generate Java code using fulib.
The [Quickstart](quickstart/README.md) chapter is less detailed, but is easier and faster to read and understand.
More details can be found in [Definitions](definitions/README.md).
